Project Summary: Factors Affecting Superstore Sales

Objective:
The project aims to analyze factors influencing sales in a Superstore, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to identify weak points contributing to lower sales, with a focus on specific goods in different regions. The ultimate objective is to provide insights that can assist the Superstore in optimizing its strategies and increasing overall sales.

Data Source:
The dataset, comprising 13 variables, originates from Kaggle Datasets and represents the sales data of a Superstore. The dataset includes information on shipment modes, quantities, cities, states, categories, and other relevant factors. With 9994 observations, the dataset is comprehensive, containing no missing values.

Key Issues/Problems to Address:

Identify factors contributing to lower sales.
Explore regional variations in sales for specific goods.
Provide actionable insights to enhance sales performance.
R Packages for Analysis:

Hmisc - Data analysis and character string manipulation.
psych - Basic descriptive statistics.
rlang - Evaluation of variables and functions.
